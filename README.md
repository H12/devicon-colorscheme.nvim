# DevIcon Colorscheme

DevIcon-Colorscheme allows you to change the color of the original devicons and use any color you like on them.

After developing my own colorscheme, I noticed that the devicons [devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons) always kept the same color. I am aware that the colors represent the brand of the product, but I want to have a uniform look!
